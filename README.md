About this new Flutter project.

With this project, I apply my acquired knowledge about the use and consumption of API's (pub.dev).

This project uses and consumes two different API's (GYPHY API's). The first presents the 20 most searched gifs at the time of your query. The second searches for your choice of the first 19 items located by the API, opening another query in the twentieth position.

In addition, I applied the function of sharing by long press on the consulted images and sharing by button, opening the desired image.

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  share:
  transparent_image:
  http:

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_launcher_icons: "^0.11.0"
